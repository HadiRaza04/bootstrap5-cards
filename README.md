Make some cards using bootstrap properties from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>.

1) A basic card is created with the <b>.card</b> class, and content inside the card has a <b>.card-body</b> class.

2) The <b>.card-header</b> class adds a heading to the card and the <b>.card-footer</b> class adds a footer to the card.

3) To add a background color the card, use contextual classes <b>(.bg-primary, .bg-success, .bg-info, .bg-warning, .bg-danger, .bg-secondary, .bg-dark and .bg-light)</b>.

4) Use <b>.card-title</b> to add card titles to any heading element. The <b>.card-text</b> class is used to remove bottom margins for a <b>p></b> element if it is the last child 
(or the only one) inside <b>.card-body</b>. The <b>.card-link</b> class adds a blue color to any link, and a hover effect.

5) Add <b>.card-img-top</b> or <b>.card-img-bottom </b>to an <b>img></b> to place the image at the top or at the bottom inside the card. Note that we have added the
image outside of the <b>.card-body</b> to span the entire width.

6) Turn an image into a card background and use <b>.card-img-overlay</b> to add text on top of the image.
